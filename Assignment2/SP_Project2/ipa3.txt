The Definitive Top 10 IPAs, as Chosen by a Hopped-Up Panel of Beer Writers Dan
Gentile

Stouts and sours and Scotch ales are all gifts from the beer god named "God,
	   But The One Who Works On The Beer," but the IPA is the once and current
	   king of craft brews. So we felt it was our duty, as people who drink
	   stuff, to ask nine illustrious beer scribes to pick their 10 favorites,
	   and explain why all others pale in comparison. Sorry. For the pale
	   thing, not for all the hard work we put in so you know exactly what to
	   drink.

[Editor's Note: We were strictly looking to find the finest IPAs, not double
IPAs or triple IPAs or duodecuple IPAs. Although we love those too, don't
worry.]

At a “business” lunch at the Good Dog, I had the most pleasant opportunity to
order a second beer. I settled on a Lagunitas IPA for two reasons. First, I had
had other Lagunitas offerings before and thoroughly enjoyed them. The second
reason was that the Lagunitas was on-tap and as my first beer was out of the
bottle, I wanted a fresher pour. The IPA came icy cold with a refreshing scent
of hops. There was an ample amount of foam that quickly dissipated and left a
beautiful golden color. I found that the IPA had just enough hops for flavor
but without the overly bitter finish that comes from some of the other
over-hopped attempts at an IPA. Overall, a good beer that left me wishing that
the “business” lunch could have gone a beer or two longer. I would give it a B+
(same as the average score at the Beer Advocate).
